//!
//! This library provides decoding of PPM pulse edges into PPM frames.
//! It does not require a particular interrupt handling or input pin
//! measurement strategy.  All the user needs to provide is the
//! relative timing of pulses, and the library will extract PPM
//! frames from that.
//!
//! PPM channel values are encoded as the gap between multiple pulses.
//! Typically PPM pulses are high values and the gaps between them
//! are low values; however, some PPM receivers invert the signal,
//! where the PPM signal is pulled high and pulses are low values.
//! PPM frames consist of multiple channels encoded in this way,
//! with a longer duration gap between the last channel and the
//! first channel, after which comes the next frame.
//! This frame-separating gap is referred to as a frame sync or reset.
//! So a PPM frame with five channels might look like:
//!
//! ______|___|___|___|___|___|______
//! Where high values are the pulses and low values are the
//! gaps between pulses. The pulse duration itself is typically
//! tuned to be as short as possible and still reliably transmitted.
//!
//! The library provides defaults for common configuration values
//! such as:
//! - Minimum PPM channel value (the minimum gap between pulses)
//! - Maximum PPM channel value (the maximum gap between pulses)
//! - Minimum frame sync duration (the minimum time for a gap between
//! pulses to be considered a frame sync / reset)
//! - Minimum number of PPM channels to be considered a valid frame.
//!
